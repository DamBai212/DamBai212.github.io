  What is a Bot? To put simply bots are computer programs you typically interact with through written or a spoken language, that is meant to make your life easier. They’ve become widely popular among numerous active users of messengers(e.g. “Slack”) since they have various scopes of use — from entertaining content including step-by-step games to hacking into databases, tracking deliveries, and even making traveling suggestions for your next holiday. The usage possibilities for bots are endless.

  The complexity of a bot all depends on the creator and their target user. Major fortune 500 companies use chat-bots on their online platforms as a way to help users navigate the site while collecting information on the said user, based on the content they view. That's just the tip of the iceberg though, within the last five years or so, companies like Google and Amazon have been utilizing bots in devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo. These devices have been programmed with a "personal assisant" bot (e.g Alexa). Coming with a wide array of functions from ordering take out or organizing a users busy schedule.
	
	If you're a newbie such as myself on the concept of bots and other AI related software. I suggest getting familiar with the programming language Python. It plays an essentail part in the machine learning world mainly because a vast majority of bots are coded in Python. Known as being a very user friendly programming language, you don't need to be an expert coder to start building your first bot with Python.
